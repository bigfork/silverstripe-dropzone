# SilverStripe DropzoneField

A Dropzone.js field for SilverStripe 4 - designed to be used on the frontend, not in the CMS.

## Work in progress

Config options are listed here: https://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration. Most config options should already work, support for some hasnâ€™t been added yet.

#### Stuff that works:

- File uploads
- Multiple files per request (`->setDropzoneConfigOption('uploadMultiple', true)`)
- "Chunked" file uploads (`->setDropzoneConfigOption('chunking', true)`)
- Removing existing files

#### Stuff that doesn't work:

- Re-ordering files - Dropzone.js doesn't appear to support this out of the box
- Server-side thumbnail generation

## Contributing

Dropzone forces jQuery as a dependency: https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/issues/1495 / https://gitlab.com/meno/dropzone/-/issues/2. So before compiling, please manually remove the following lines from dropzone.js (in node_modules): https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/08b9e0a763b54a685404dea523a9c54242fbe1b9/dist/dropzone.js#L3200-L3207
